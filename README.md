The Asctiiroid
==============

This is an attempt at a turn-based hex-grid cave-flyer for
2018's 7-day roguelike challenge.

The WER/SDF keys point your ship in the six directions (this
consumes a turn).  'A' accelerates (also consumes a turn).  'Z'
does nothing for a turn (you continue to move at the current
velocity).

I've had this idea in the back of my mind for a year or two.  I
attempted it for a past 7DRL but had an unexpectedly bonkers
week and didn't only got as far as drawing a basic hex grid.  I
think I might make it this year.  As of this writing I'm nearing
the end of day 4, and collision handling seems to be working.  I
*think* that's the last of the major mechanical pieces.

So that gives me three days to build the gameplay.  I'm planning
to keep it to a few enemy and weapon types, with some simple
interactions between types to give it a little bit of that
roguelike zaniness.  Three days ought to be adequate.  I think.
