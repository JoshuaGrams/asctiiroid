The Asctiiroid
==============

This is an attempt at a turn-based hex-grid cave-flyer for
2018's 7-day roguelike challenge.

Keys (I've used scancodes, so hopefully these are in the QWERTY
positions even if you're using a different keyboard layout):

* UIO/JKL (right hand) - Aim your ship (uses a turn).
* D - Accelerate (uses a turn).
* S or F - Fire a shot, if you have ammo.
* E - Boost (higher acceleration if you have fuel: uses a turn).
* W or R - Use an exit or grab an upgrade.
* Space - Wait for one turn (drift at the current velocity).

I've used the Asteroids mechanic where you have a limited number
of active bullets.

I've had this idea in the back of my mind for a year or two.  I
attempted it for a past 7DRL but had an unexpectedly bonkers
week and only got as far as drawing a basic hex grid.
